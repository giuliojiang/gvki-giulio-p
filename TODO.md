* Teach testing framework to actually validate the contents of the JSON file.
* The testing framework programs have a large amount of duplication and this
  should really be cleaned up.
* Figure out a way to test other GVKI features e.g. the different behaviour
  when using the environment variables.
* The environment variable names need cleaning up. Giving ``GVKI_ROOT`` two
  different meanings based on another variable name is confusing.
* Clang-format the code base.
